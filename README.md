# wrapper11
a simple function/method call wrapper with C++11.

On situation of AOP, it is hard to weave code into C++ code at runtime, but, it is possible to wrap funciton/method calling at compile time. here a wrapper of C++11 is proposed, and features:

* wrap function and class method
* wrapper also can be wrapped
* wrapper return values as original function or class method
* call wrapper as call the original function or class method

for demostration, please refer to src/test_cpp11_wrapper.cc  .
